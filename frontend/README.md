# full-stack-interview

This folder contains the frontend part of the World of V interview challenge. Included in the folder is a working react app based on [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
$ npm run start
```

## Challenge

Edit `src/App.tsx` to make an API call to the backend server and render a paginated list of tracks
using the `getTracks` query you wrote in the previous challenge.
You are free to implement pagination the way you find the most ergonomic. You can use a load more button, infinite scroll, or a pagination component. The challenge requirements are purposefully very loose so we can get a feel for your code style.
Feel free to create as many files and components as you deem necessary.
You are allowed to install any package as you see fit. You can use any helper library or UI toolkit that you find useful.

### **Note**

Do NOT go crazy on styling. This challenge is meant to verify your understanding of the flow of data in a React application. Feel free to use default browser styles and don't worry if the result looks plain/ugly/boring. What we care about is that the pagination logic works correctly and that the code is readable and efficent.
